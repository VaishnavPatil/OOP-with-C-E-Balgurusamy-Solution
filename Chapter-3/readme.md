# Object Oriented Programming with C++ Exercises

This repository contains solutions to the programming exercises found in the book "Object Oriented Programming with C++" by E. Balagurusamy. The exercises cover a wide range of topics related to object-oriented programming (OOP) using the C++ programming language.

## Chapter 3 - Exercise 3.1

### Exercise 3.1 Code: [Exercise_3_1.cpp](https://github.com/VaishnavPatil/OOP-with-C-E-Balgurusamy-Solution/blob/main/Chapter-3/Exercise_3_1.cpp)

This C++ program, part of Chapter 3, demonstrates a simple implementation. Users are prompted to enter two integer values, and the program then displays the original values before swapping. The `swap` function, designed to take two integer pointers as parameters, facilitates the exchange of values stored in the memory locations pointed to by these pointers. Following the swap, the program prints the updated values.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the values of `a` and `b` as prompted.
3. Observe the original values and the values after swapping.

## Code Overview

- The `swap` function takes two integer pointers and swaps the values they point to.
- The `main` function:
  - Prompts the user to input two integers.
  - Displays the original values.
  - Calls the `swap` function to interchange the values.
  - Outputs the modified values.

This program serves as a fundamental illustration of pointer usage in C++ for swapping variables.
