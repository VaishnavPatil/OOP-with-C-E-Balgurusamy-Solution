# C++ Swap Program

This C++ program showcases a simple implementation for swapping two integer values using pointers. Users are prompted to input two values, and the program subsequently displays the original values before performing the swap. The `swap` function, designed to take two integer pointers as parameters, facilitates the exchange of values stored in the memory locations pointed to by these pointers. Following the swap, the program prints the updated values.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the values of `a` and `b` as prompted.
3. Observe the original values and the values after swapping.

## Code Overview

- The `swap` function takes two integer pointers and swaps the values they point to.
- The `main` function:
  - Prompts the user to input two integers.
  - Displays the original values.
  - Calls the `swap` function to interchange the values.
  - Outputs the modified values.

This program serves as a fundamental illustration of pointer usage in C++ for swapping variables.
